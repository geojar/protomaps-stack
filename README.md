# üó∫Ô∏è Protomaps Stack

A collection of tools and assets by [GeoJar](https://github.com/geojar) to self-host and serve vector basemaps using [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/) and [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/).

This stack allows for downloading, serving, and visualizing vector tiles with a lightweight, fully self-hosted setup.

## üì¶ Repositories

### [`protomaps-assets-basemaps`](https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-assets-basemaps)
Clones the official [Protomaps basemaps](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps) into a GeoJar-managed repository. These assets can be customized and are intended to be published for use with MapLibre GL JS.

### [`protomaps-assets-maplibre`](https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-assets-maplibre)
Includes the necessary frontend assets to render a map using MapLibre:
- HTML map viewer
- CSS & JavaScript
- JSON configuration files for style and sources

This is the public-facing map viewer component.

### [`protomaps-tileserver-docker`](https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-tileserver-docker)
Dockerized Protomaps tileserver setup. This includes:
- A tile server capable of serving PMTiles
- A download helper script to fetch vector tiles from Protomaps
  - Download the full world
  - Or extract tiles by bounding box

---

## üåê Use Case

This stack is ideal for:
- Hosting custom basemaps without relying on third-party tile servers
- Offline or edge deployments
- Full control over style, tiles, and performance
